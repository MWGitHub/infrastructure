# Digital Ocean Tags

Creates tags for resources to use.

Tags are not tied to ports or IPs but are more of a signal for what type a resource is or what types a resource allows.

## Tag Types

* public
    * Signals a resource which is accessible to the world.
* restricted
    * Signals a resource that is internal.
* ssh
    * Signals a resource that can be secure shelled into.
* whitelist
    * Signals a resource that allows any whitelisted IPs.
